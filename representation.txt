 This is a first attempt to represent Cyclone in ELF in the same way that Harper & Licata represented the STLC.

 The goal is to make an adequate representation but there are four issues:

 1) Heap - the heap and locations must be represented.
 2) & x p - is a value, which is a location.
 3) upsilon - context of x p tau.
 4) let - let is used with a heap instead of HOAS.

 The names are somewhat odd as I'm following the Coq names which have
 more restrictions due to libraries.
